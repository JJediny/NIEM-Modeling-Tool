## How to Contribute

This project constitutes a collaborative work ("open source"). Federal employees and members of the public are encouraged to improve the project by contributing.

## License

Unfortunately, we must release this initially under a very restrictive license that limits rights and use of the tool to "federal purposes." We are working hard to resolve this, and hope to eventually transition to the MIT license for the code and the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license for all other associated work. Until then, however, the license for this project is:

The Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs reserves a royalty-free, non-exclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use and authorize others to use (in whole or in part, including in connection with derviative works), for federal purposes, this work and any rights of copyright to this work.

The Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs hereby grants the public license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use (in whole or in part, including in connection with derviative works), for federal purposes, this work and any rights of copyright to this work.

Members of the public and US government employees who wish to contribute are encouraged to do so, but by contributing, dedicate their work to the public domain and waive all rights to their contribution under the terms of the [CC0 Public Domain Dedication](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
